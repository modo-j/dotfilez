#### A dump for my ever-evolving mess of configuration files. 


I've tried to eliminate everything I've stolen, or *kanged*, over the years with no credit given (I 
haven't 
always been the best at documenting my *inspiration*), but if you come across something here that I do 
not own, and don't have permission to share, don't hesitate to call me out. There are so many github 
repos, Archwiki pages, StackOverflow answers, etc, that have shaped the mess I'll be sharing here, I'm 
sorry I cannot pin-point every source of code I drew inspiration from. I'm no expert, so I'm always open 
to suggestions for 
improvement. Considering the vast amount of much better dotfile repos out there, I doubt many 
will ever 
find their way here, but if you do, I would appreciate if you let me know what you use, and how you use 
it. Thanks!


I'm going to be working on improvements before committing much to this repo, so for now, a README will 
have to do. :P
